# Intro

We are working on simple html page for Lithuania (and other Baltic states) with statistics on Corona virus spread.
The current html page adress is [https://justasmundeikis.github.io/corona_virus_statisics/](https://justasmundeikis.github.io/corona_virus_statisics/)

This project has 3 main goals:

1. To gather micro level statistics on cases in the Baltic states which allows for more detail insights
2. Enhance our knowlegde on working with Rstudio / Rwmakrdown
3. Try to do some econometric calcualtions to estimate the spread and the results of the virus

# Todo

We need people who gather micro level data for **Latvia** and **Estonia**. The intension is to use
[google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l9HM2hIjLFA-SZy_kO8b8B5Ddr0hfVZrmx2Yb1n1feg/edit?userstoinvite=rokas.klydzia@gmail.com&ts=5e6cdf03&actionButton=1#gid=0) to gather all data. If there are any suggestions on how to optimize the workflow, just let us know
